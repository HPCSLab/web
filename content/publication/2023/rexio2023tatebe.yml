  abstract = {The increasing difference in performance between computing and storage has caused significant problems for HPC systems. To reduce the difference in performance, intermediate storage layers have been introduced; however, the flushing strategy is a significant issue in these layers. Dirty data must be flushed to efficiently utilize the intermediate storage layers although this may degrade I/O performance and cause instability because data access and flushing interfere with each other. In this study, an I/O-aware mechanism that does not interfere with I/O activity is proposed for data flushing, using HPC-specific workloads. Evaluations based on HPC application benchmarks in MPI-IO and NetCDF demonstrated the performance advantages of the proposed I/O-aware flushing, with the I/O performance of the intermediate storage layers displaying minimum degradation and remaining stable during flushing.},
