  The supercomputing now is using different kind of accelerator very often,
  the "traditional" way of using them is by OpenCL.
  Intel now introduce a new unified programming platform â€” oneAPI,
  the platform provided the runtime and library to program different accelerator,
  including host code. That's a great contribition to heterogeneous computing,
  and now I'm trying to use it to program both GPU and FPGA.
